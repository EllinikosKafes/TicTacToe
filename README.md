# Python_TicTacToe

This is a simple Python game Tic-Tac-Toe I made in 2 days. 

I made it mostly because I wanted a break from advanced Python concepts and
preffered to vibe-code for a litte bit.

I tried making it as structured as I can , using many python files instead of
a large one , each with its purpose and functions (trying to stay consinstent
on writing clean code and building expandable projects)

I also wanted to finally make a **multiplayer** game (via LAN), so I can practice
on my server-client projects. Even though a basic one, I believe that it was 
worth building.
